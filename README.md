# Crypto Balance Transfer Application

# Why?
Blockchain helps in the verification and traceability of multistep transactions needing verification and traceability. It can provide secure transactions, reduce compliance costs, and speed up data transfer processing. Blockchain technology can help contract management and audit the origin of a product.


# What? 
This hello-world application to help anyone to understand how to architect, build, deploy & communicate with Blockchain apps in Etherium blockchain. 

What does this application do?

This BlockChain sample Application help us to 
1. Undertand the steps to Architect the scalable Blockchain App.
2. Understand and develop a Smart Contracts with Solidity 
3. Connect the Smart Contract to a React App 
4. Authenticate transations viva MetaMask
5. Transfer Crypto currency(ETH) from one account to another
6. Automate the deployments using Infrastucture as Code 
5. Make the applicaiton Production ready with best practicies


# How ?

1. Curious to know the Architecture of Web 3.0 applications and what to consider to build them ground up? Don't miss this [article](web3.0/smart_contract/Architecture.md)
2. To know, what to do and what not to do while developing Blockchain Apps, follow this [link](web3.0/smart_contract/Steps_to_upgrade.md)
3. Want to know, how to deploy the FrontEnd application into the Infrastructure? Follow this github actions 
4. How to connect web applications to Smart Contracts directly? Refer the existing React application
5. How to integrate the Backend APIs to connect with Smart Contracts?
6. How to authenticate Blockchian Applications from MobileApps?

# Developer Experience

1. What is the easy way to develop and test smart contracts? Use https://chainide.com/ 
2. What are the ways to upgrade the blockchain apps? 
3. More to be added....


# What is next?
1. Deploy the FE and attach to a host
2. Probaby deploy it in our own Nodes
